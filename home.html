        <h1>Home</h1>
            <p>Incorporated in February 2019, d.FL, a start-up technology company where our beachhead strategy is to focus our resources on digitisation of process handling and turn our product into a stronghold before entering the broader market.</p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>We see a future in digitisation of process handling, as well as process control, quality/quantity assessment, measurement, condition monitoring, and informed decision making (go, no-go) by industrial and common users.</p>
            <p>As an independent company we are building a reputation using our knowledge and technology to deliver high quality effective digitisation and digitalisation solutions.</p>
        <h3>Vision & Mission</h3>
            <p>Our vision is to be a world-leading in digitisation of process handling. Our mission is to empowering customers to build e-platform of process handling, where data could be recorded, extracted, analysed, stored, shared with IoT in positive and ethical way.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <h4>Technology Field</h4>
                <p>We are developing solutions to scan surface conditions using remote sensing methods. We are working on developing original sensing methods, data communication & data analytics platform. The platform will detect, connect, and predict the surface conditions, giving the location and extent of retention of foreign object on surface, surface degradation or contamination if present.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
                <p>We recognise that surface conditions of runways, roads, racetracks, helipads, flight decks, rail tracks, including other surface types of assets (renewable and civil infrastructures, materials & manufacturing, high value equipment, etc) impacts range of industries and our daily life. We are open to innovate and adapt to develop the technology for applications which can be implemented in a variety of situations.</p>
